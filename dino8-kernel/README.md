# dino8-kernel — Chunk 1: Geometry Kernel Wrapper

Scope: Phase 0 of the Dino 8 blueprint. Wraps McNeel's open-source
[OpenNURBS](https://github.com/mcneel/opennurbs) toolkit with a smaller,
Dino8-facing API for NURBS curves/surfaces, B-reps, degree elevation, and
`.3dm` file I/O. This is the foundation every later chunk (booleans, SubD,
viewport, command engine) builds on.

## Exit criteria (from the blueprint's Phase 0 row)

- [x] Project builds and links against OpenNURBS
- [x] Can construct a NURBS curve and degree-elevate it
- [x] Can construct a NURBS surface and degree-elevate it
- [x] Can open and save a `.3dm` file (round-trip)
- [ ] Curve/surface edit operations beyond construction (left for the next
      kernel chunk — booleans/SubD depend on this API surface existing first)

## Layout

```
dino8-kernel/
  CMakeLists.txt          top-level build, fetches OpenNURBS
  include/dino8/kernel/   public wrapper headers
  src/                    wrapper implementation
  tests/                  round-trip + smoke tests
```

## Building

Requires a C++17 compiler and CMake ≥ 3.20. OpenNURBS source is pulled via
`FetchContent` at configure time (network access required) rather than
vendored, so this checks out and pins to a specific OpenNURBS tag.

```
cmake -S dino8-kernel -B dino8-kernel/build
cmake --build dino8-kernel/build
ctest --test-dir dino8-kernel/build --output-on-failure
```

If your OpenNURBS checkout exposes a different CMake target name than
`opennurbs_public` (this varies across OpenNURBS releases), adjust the
`target_link_libraries` call in `CMakeLists.txt` — the comment there marks
the exact spot.

## Why this shape

- The wrapper types (`dino8::kernel::NurbsCurve`, `NurbsSurface`, `Brep`)
  intentionally mirror OpenNURBS' own object model rather than inventing a
  parallel one — later chunks (mesh booleans, SubD-to-NURBS conversion)
  need direct access to the underlying `ON_*` objects, not just a
  simplified facade.
- File I/O goes through `ONX_Model`, OpenNURBS' own model container, so
  `.3dm` compatibility comes from OpenNURBS directly instead of being
  reimplemented.

## Known gaps / next chunk's problem

- No boolean operations yet (chunk 2).
- No SubD support yet (chunk 3) — OpenNURBS has `ON_SubD` but this chunk
  doesn't wrap it.
- No tolerance-management policy defined yet; wrapper calls use
  OpenNURBS defaults, which will need revisiting once real modeling
  tolerances are decided.
