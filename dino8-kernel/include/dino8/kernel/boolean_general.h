// General boundary-evaluation boolean engine.
//
// Unlike boolean.cpp's BooleanCombineMixed (which is hand-solved,
// closed-form geometry enumerated per surface-TYPE-pair: plane+plane,
// plane+cylinder, cylinder+cylinder, ...), BooleanCombineGeneral works on
// ANY pair of ON_Surface-based faces by actually running the general
// surface/surface intersector (dino8/kernel/surface_intersect.h) between
// every (bbox-overlapping) face pair, splitting each face's own trim loop
// along the resulting intersection curves, classifying each fragment
// in/out of the other solid by ray-casting (via the general curve/surface
// intersector, not hand-solved ray-vs-plane/ray-vs-cylinder formulas), and
// reassembling the kept fragments into a genuine ON_Brep (real
// ON_BrepVertex/ON_BrepEdge/ON_BrepLoop/ON_BrepTrim topology, coincident
// points welded into shared vertices/edges - the same identity mechanism
// Brep::FromMixedFaces() already uses, just generalized to an arbitrary
// ON_Surface instead of only a plane/cylinder/cone).
//
// Scope/limitations (see boolean_general.cpp's own top comment for the
// full disclosure): a face is expected to carry at most one "outer"
// intersection component per opposing face pair that either (a) closes
// entirely inside the face's own trim (a closed loop - becomes a hole in
// the untouched fragment plus a separate interior fragment), or (b) meets
// the face's own trim boundary at exactly two points (an open arc - splits
// that trim boundary into two fragments there). Faces are assumed genus-0
// (no pre-existing holes) two-shell solids. Multiple non-interacting
// chains on the same face are supported (each is spliced in turn); chains
// that cross EACH OTHER on the same face are not.
