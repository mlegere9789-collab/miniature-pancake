// Wraps ON_Brep.
//
// IMPORTANT CORRECTION to the original blueprint this kernel is built
// from: OpenNURBS ships zero boolean/CSG operations. There is no
// BooleanUnion, BooleanIntersection, or BooleanDifference anywhere in its
// public API, for B-reps or for meshes — verified directly against the
// v8.34 source, not assumed. OpenNURBS's own docs are explicit that it's
// a geometry *representation* library (curves, surfaces, breps, meshes,
// file I/O), not a modeling kernel with solid operations on top. Rhino's
// actual boolean engine is closed-source and lives outside OpenNURBS.
//
// What OpenNURBS *does* give us: exact tessellation of a Brep into
// ON_Mesh objects (Tessellate() below). That's the real foundation a
// boolean engine needs — an actual mesh-boolean algorithm (e.g. a
// vetted library like Manifold, or a from-scratch BSP/CSG
// implementation) is a distinct, substantial next chunk, not something
// "wrapping OpenNURBS" gets us for free.

  // Builds a genuine closed solid: an axis-aligned box as six untrimmed
  // bilinear NURBS faces (min corner (x0,y0,z0), max corner (x1,y1,z1)),
  // each oriented so its tessellated triangles face outward. This is what
  // closes the gap the previous chunk's README called out: without it,
  // Brep only ever produced open surfaces, so nothing built through Brep
  // could feed BooleanCombine() (which requires a closed, watertight
  // mesh) - tests had to hand-build box meshes directly instead. Box() is
  // deliberately narrow (one primitive, no general solid construction);
  // it exists to prove the Brep -> Tessellate -> weld -> boolean pipeline
  // end to end, not to be a real primitive library.

  // Builds a genuine closed solid from a single curved face: a sphere,
  // via OpenNURBS' own exact rational-NURBS conversion (ON_Sphere::
  // GetNurbForm) rather than an approximation we'd have to derive
  // ourselves. Unlike Box() (six flat faces stitched at seams), this
  // is one face whose own tessellation seam and poles have to be welded
  // shut with itself - the specific case the previous chunk's README
  // flagged as unvalidated ("not yet validated against curved surfaces").
  static Brep Sphere(Point3d center, double radius);

  // Builds a one-face B-rep whose face is `surface`, trimmed to
  // `trim_loop_uv`: a closed polygon in the surface's own (u, v)
  // parameter space. This is real (if simplified) B-rep trimming - the
  // gap every earlier primitive here sidestepped by only ever building
  // whole untrimmed or whole-closed surfaces. `trim_loop_uv` is stored
  // here rather than as genuine ON_Brep loop/trim/edge topology (a much
  // larger API surface - vertices, edges, 2D and 3D curve pairing,
  // orientation); what this closes is the tessellation-visible gap
  // ("no trimmed surfaces" meant no way to produce a trimmed *shape* at
  // all), not full topological B-rep validity. See NurbsSurface::
  // TessellateGrid's trim_polygon parameter for how the polygon is
  // actually applied.
  //
  // `exact_clip`, if true, tessellates via NurbsSurface::
  // TessellateGridClippedExact() instead of the default whole-cell
  // TessellateGrid() path - real boundary clipping instead of an
  // approximation that only improves with grid resolution. `trim_loop_uv`
  // may be convex or concave (see that method's own comment for how each
  // is handled). Defaults to false so existing whole-cell behavior (and
  // the exact vertex/triangle counts tests assert against it) doesn't
  // change under callers that don't ask for this.
  //
  // `hole_loops_uv`, if non-empty, are additional closed polygons
  // subtracted from the outer trim - an annulus/washer face (a square
  // with a smaller square hole, say). Only supported on the whole-cell
  // path: throws std::invalid_argument if combined with exact_clip=true,
  // since Sutherland-Hodgman clips against a single convex region and
  // doesn't have a "subtract another region" mode.
